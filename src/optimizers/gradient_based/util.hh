/// @brief Inlined utility functions for gradient-descent optimizers.
/// @details This is a header-only set of mathematical utility functions.  Since these are entirely
/// defined in the header and inlined, inclusion of this file results in efficient machine code,
/// at the cost of slightly greater compilation time.
